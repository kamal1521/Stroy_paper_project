        Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.

        <h2>PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY :</h2>
        <img src="https://editaphotography.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Newborn_photographer_Pune_Edita_photography004-1.jpg" height="150px" width="150px" align="right">
        <p><b>T</b>he simple definition of portrait photography is a style of photography that captures people and aims to convey a story or emotion through the image. However, like all photography, there is much more involved in creating a strong portrait than pointing the lens and releasing the shutter. Now that you have a sense of what the purpose or meaning of portrait photography is, let’s get into what it actually entails.
        <br>Portraits existed long before the invention of photography. Far before there was a camera even to take a photograph, rulers and monarchs hired painters to paint their own portraits.<br> Today, portrait photography has taken the place of this tradition. Portrait photographers as tasked with the ambitious goal of capturing the identity of a subject in a single image.<br> What is portrait photography and what types are there? In this article, well answer these questions and take a look at the types that exist depending on the subject and goal of a photograph.
        <br>Lifestyle portrait photography takes a more casual approach than traditional portraits. Rather than being shot in a studio, lifestyle portraits are typically shot in a real world environment and more closely resemble real life. They may still make use of professional lighting setups, but the style is natural and realistic.
            Subjects may be directed but aren’t posed. Instead of being told to look up at a certain angle or move their chin a certain way, they might be asked to walk from point A to point B or to interact with each other if there is more than one person being photographed.

        <h2>WEDDINH PHOTOGRAPHY :</h2>

        <p><b>Y</b>ou will most likely be busy on your wedding day. With the number of guests you have, its’ also difficult to keep track of everything that’s happening. Your wedding photographer will be there to help you see moments you weren’t able to witness during the day.
        <br>Your wedding is when weeks, months, or even years of planning your big day comes together. You can see the result of every decision made with colors, decor, and wedding vendors. You’ll be able to enjoy it during the day, but being able to look back to how it all came together can be fun and allows you to take in every detail.
        <br>A wedding is an opportunity for family members located in other states or even countries to visit and see you. They can’t visit all the time, so it’s an opportunity to make the most of the time you have together and take a couple of portraits with the family.
        <br>Wedding photography can also be shared, especially with family members who weren’t able to attend the wedding. It’s also fun to show wedding images to children and grandchildren to allow them to share in the moment with you, even if they were not around to witness it yet.

        <h2>STREET PHOTOGRAPHY :</h2>

        <p><b>T</b>here is a case to be made about the allure of honesty and art. Perhaps this is the biggest argument for the growing popularity of street photography. On one side of the photography coin you have controlled, polished, studio photography that is artistic and moving in its own right.
         <br> On the other side of that coin is street photography. What is street photography, what defines it, why are people drawn to it, and how can you capture it yourself? Let’s find out.Street photography is a photographic practice of shooting people in everyday life in everyday environments. These photographers commonly aim to capture spontaneous moments of people in a candid state.
         <br> Street photography is typically not directed or staged. Rather, it is unmediated and spontaneous as to capture subjects in their most authentic state. Despite the term, street photography is not limited to busy cities or rural areas. This types of photography can be taken anywhere that sparks your curiosity.  First and foremost, check the laws where you are shooting. Within the United States and Canada, taking and using photographs of a person without their permission is completely legal unless it is for commercial use. Here is a great video by Sean Tucker having a conversation with an actual legal team about the laws and logistics of street photography.

        <h2>ARCHTECTURAL Photography :</h2>

        <p><b>O</b>ur modern day, image-obsessed culture has got us consuming a large quantity of architecture through photographs, as opposed to physical, spatial experiences. The advantages of architectural photography are great; it allows people to obtain a visual understanding of buildings they may never get the opportunity to visit in their lifetime, creating a valuable resource that allows us to expand our architectural vocabulary. However, one must stay critical towards the disadvantages of photography when it comes to architecture. Jeremy Till, author of “Architecture Depends,” summarizes this in his chapter “Out Of Time”: “The photograph allows us to forget what has come before (the pain of extended labor to achieve the delivery of the fully formed building) and what is to come after (the affront of time as dirt, users, change, and weather move in). It freezes time or, rather, freezes out time. Architectural photography ‘lifts the building out of time, out of breath,’ and in this provides solace for architects who can dream for a moment that architecture is a stable power existing over and above the tides of time.”
         The following tips aim to not only improve the visual strength of your architectural photography, but also the stories that they can tell—going beyond the individual images in order to communicate buildings’ relationships with their contexts, space and time.
        
        <h2>STILL PHOTOGRAPHY :</h2>
        <img src="https://121clicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/anna_nemoy_02.jpg" height="160px" width="160px" align="right">
        <p><b>T</b>hroughout its long history, still life has taken many forms, from the decorative frescos of antiquity to the high art of the Renaissance. Traditionally, a still life is a collection of inanimate objects arranged as the subject of a composition. Nowadays, a still life can be anything from your latest Instagram latte art to a vase of tulips styled like a Dutch Golden Age painting.
        Creating a beautiful and successful still life image is an impressive feat, but just as painting a bowl of fruit is a good introduction for new painters, still life photography is a wonderful training ground for new photographers. It gives you an opportunity to experiment with light, materials, textures and subjects in a controlled setting. Whatever your creative vision and artistic goals, still life is a great place to start.Still life photography encompasses everything that is an inanimate subject in front of a camera. But a successful still life? That’s a little harder to classify. It all comes down to intent and context. Is your message conveyed? Is your composition strong and does it guide the viewer’s eye through the image? Does your still life convey a narrative? It’s by asking these deeper questions that we can understand whether a photograph is successful.
        
        <h2>NATURAL PHOTOGRAPHY :</h2>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d5/21/61/d521615893b4c668599e99f3fc226992.jpg" height="160px" width="160px" align="left">
        <p><b>N</b>ature photography is a wide range of photography taken outdoors and devoted to displaying natural elements such as landscapes, wildlife, plants, and close-ups of natural scenes and textures. Nature photography tends to put a stronger emphasis on the aesthetic value of the photo than other photography genres, such as photojournalism and documentary photography. [1]
         "Nature photography" overlaps the fields of—and is sometimes considered an overarching category including -- "wildlife photography," "landscape photography," and "garden photography".[1]
         Nature photographs are published in scientific, travel and cultural magazines such as National Geographic Magazine, National Wildlife Magazine and Audubon Magazine or other more specific magazines such as Outdoor Photographer and Nature's Best Photography. Well known nature photographers include Ansel Adams, Eliot Porter, Frans Lanting, Galen Rowell, and Art Wolfe.Nature itself is extremely multi-faceted, so it’s no surprise that there are quite a few different types of nature photography. These types are often considered to be their own complete genres, with techniques, strategies, styles, and famous works that embody each field. 
         If you’re new to nature photography, it can be a useful exercise to explore each of these types separately, particularly if you’re interested in pursuing one or more as a hobby or career. Here’s a snapshot of the various types of nature photography to get you started.
